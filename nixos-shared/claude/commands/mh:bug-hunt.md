# /bug-hunt - Claude Code Slash Command

## **üîç Command Definition**

### **Purpose**
Systematically hunt for bugs using structured investigation methodology rather than general code exploration.

```

### **Parameters**
- `action`: Investigation type (compare, analyze, trace, history)
- `target`: Code component to investigate (required)
- `focus-area`: Domain-specific area to examine (optional)

```

### **2. Analyze Action**
```
/bug-hunt analyze [Component] [focus-area] [hypothesis] [flags]
```
Deep investigation of single component for potential issues.

```

### **3. Trace Action**
```
/bug-hunt trace [StartPoint] to [EndPoint] [failure-scenario] [flags]
```
Follow execution flow hunting for issues in the data/control flow.

## **üî¨ Investigation Protocol**

When `/bug-hunt` is invoked, Claude Code will:

### **1. Parse Intent**
- Extract target components from command
- Identify investigation scope and focus areas
- Note any hypothesis provided by user

### **2. Set Investigation Mode**
- **Assume bugs exist** (not neutral analysis)
- **Focus on runtime failures** vs surface code differences
- **Prioritize customer-impacting issues**

### **3. Apply Systematic Framework**

#### **Critical Path Analysis**
- Identify business-critical code paths
- Focus on areas most likely to cause user-facing failures
- Examine error-prone patterns and edge cases

#### **Scope Verification**
- Check if data retrieval scope is complete
- Verify all required dependencies are loaded
- Look for partial loading or missing context issues

#### **Pattern Detection**
- Hunt for inconsistencies between similar components
- Identify incomplete refactoring or copy-paste errors
- Spot timing, ordering, or concurrency issues

#### **Historical Investigation**
- Git blame suspicious code sections
- Analyze commit intent vs actual implementation
- Check for incomplete feature rollouts

#### **Impact Assessment**
- Determine affected user scenarios
- Calculate business impact scope
- Assess production duration and monitoring gaps

### **4. Evidence-Based Reporting**
- **Root cause identification** with specific code locations
- **Git history context** showing when/why bug was introduced
- **Business impact assessment** with affected scenarios
- **Actionable remediation** with fix recommendations

## **üí° Key Principles**

### **1. Assume Bugs Exist**
Start with the assumption that there ARE issues to find, not neutral "let's see what's different."

### **2. Focus on Runtime Impact**
Prioritize differences that cause actual runtime failures over cosmetic code differences.

### **3. Think Customer Impact**
Always consider: "How does this affect end users?" and "What business scenarios break?"

### **4. Evidence-Based Investigation**
Collect concrete evidence: specific code locations, git commits, reproduction steps.

### **5. Actionable Outcomes**
Every bug hunt should result in clear, actionable next steps for resolution.
