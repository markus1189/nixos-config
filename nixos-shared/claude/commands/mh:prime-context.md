---

Analyze the current working state and provide a comprehensive summary:

1. Check git status to see what files are modified, staged, or untracked
2. Review git diff for unstaged changes
3. Review git diff --staged for staged changes
4. Read and analyze the actual code changes
5. Provide a clear, concise summary that includes:
   - What files are affected
   - What changes have been made to each file
   - Current state (unstaged changes, staged changes, untracked files)

Be thorough but concise. Present the facts about what has changed.
