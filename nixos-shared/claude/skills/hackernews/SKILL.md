# Hacker News CLI

Fetch top stories, search, and view comments from Hacker News.

## Tool

**Script**: [`scripts/hn-cli.sh`](scripts/hn-cli.sh) (Nix shebang, self-contained)

## Commands

### List top stories
```bash
./scripts/hn-cli.sh              # Top 20 stories
./scripts/hn-cli.sh 50           # Top 50 stories
./scripts/hn-cli.sh --hot        # Hot stories only (🔥 score ≥300 or comments ≥100)
./scripts/hn-cli.sh --hot 10     # 10 hot stories
```

### Search stories (via Algolia)
```bash
./scripts/hn-cli.sh -s "rust programming"        # Search, recent first (default)
./scripts/hn-cli.sh --search "AI" --sort popular # Search by popularity/relevance
./scripts/hn-cli.sh -s "nix flakes" 50           # Search, show 50 results (max 100)
```

### View comments
```bash
./scripts/hn-cli.sh -c STORY_ID                  # Comments for story (depth 1, max 20)
./scripts/hn-cli.sh --comments STORY_ID -d 3     # Depth 3
./scripts/hn-cli.sh -c STORY_ID -n 100           # Up to 100 comments
```

## Output format

Stories show: rank, title, domain, story ID, points, author, age, comment count, URLs.
Comments show: tree structure with author, time, and text.

Story IDs appear in brackets `[12345678]` — use these for `--comments`.

## Typical workflows

1. **Browse HN**: Run with no args, scan titles
2. **Search for topics**: Use `-s "query"` to find stories on specific topics
3. **Dive into discussion**: Note story ID, run with `-c ID -d 2`
4. **Find hot topics**: Use `--hot` to filter for trending stories
5. **Research a topic**: Search with `-s`, then fetch comments for interesting stories
6. **Summarize for user**: Fetch stories + comments, summarize key points and insights
